*h1*Biker's Oasis

The idea behind this website is to offer a place to gather for people sharing a commong passion -> motorcycles. It starts with a bit of a display of the Tuscany reagion, very famous among bikers due to it's perfect trails and views. Moving on it introduces the viewer to the location of the place and gives him some small dettails regarding it.

Features: navigation bars and links (across the main page) to help the user easly navigate trough the site
By adding images that showcase the scenery of the land and as well it's diversity (sea/hilly areas) it stimultes the user's interest in the reagion itself
By adding images containing bykers it makes the user feel closer to the content since it's displaying realtable information.

Sadly due to personal time limits the project is not fully finished

media queries are still to be implemented 
the only test (done and passed) is the lighthouse one
the readme me file (as you can already see ) is not finished

not sure it counts toward plagiarism so just in case: the social icons part of the code was built up by following the love running example
